# Book Management App
This is a simple web application for managing your book collection. It allows you to add, edit, delete, and view details of books. The application is built using HTMX, Node.js with Express, and TypeScript.

The goal was to test out basic lifecycle and state changes using HTMX and 0 js client code.
